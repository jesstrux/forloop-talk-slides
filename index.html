      # What is a PWA?

      <!-- How many are familiar with PWAs? -->

      *TLWNR:*
      
      * A Progressive Web App is a web app that has been enhanced to improve the user experience
      *based on the app's context*.

      *Mr speaker, Could you say that again but like make it longer?*

      Sure,

      * A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web technlogies such as web app manifest, service workers and IndexedDB to deliver an experience that is fast, reliable and engaging.
      A PWA is expected to harness the power of the platform it's on and gracefully adapt to situation changes such as loss of internet connection.

      ## Should you progressively enhance your web app?

      *To quote an annoying high school girl:*&nbsp; **" DUHH!!!! ðŸ™„"**

      Not convinced yet? Well here is a list(*coz well.....lists*)

      1. Fast (*both in illusion and actuality*)

      1. Increased Engagement (*push notifications*)

      1. Can feel native (*live on home screen and app launcher*)
      
      1. Can continue working offline

      1. Improved Conversions

      # Progressive Enhancement

        Obssesively tweak the little things that drive your app work really well.

        * PWA technologies don't magically fix all your app's problems

          * They build upon the existing experience

          * First optimize your traditional wep app

        * Not all PWA technologies work on every browser

        * Optimize based on specific app's context

          * *E.g. an image based app needs to focus highly on optimizing images.*

          * *A kids website needs to maximize playfulness.*

        ### Before you PWA
        
        Make your app small:

        * Compress and resize your images

        * Use SVGs instead of font files when possible.

        * Don't use a library or framework to do a script or css file job

        * Minify your source files

        ### Before you PWA cont...


        Make your app fast:

        * Use placeholders until content loads *e.g. dominant color for images*

        * Use **lightweight** loaders / state change notifiers

        * Use alternative solutions to long tasks

          * *One Click SignIn, Web Pay API*
        
        * Use web workers for memory intensive tasks

      ### Before you PWA cont...
        
      Give your app a native feel (*think beyond links and pages*)

        * Make your apps responsive (*like beyond media queries responsive*)

        * Enhance user input ( *don't default to input boxes* )

        * Add microinteractions
        
        * Make state changes smooth, snappy and intuitive (*transitions and animations*)

        * Customize empty states screens and error screens (*e.g no network*)
        
        * Reward successfull interactions ( *nice message, graphic* )

        * Use context links ( *tel: +255 7....*, *wa.me/155...?text=I'm int...* )

        * Feedback, feedback, feedback
      
      ---

      ### Before you PWA cont...
      
      * Test your app with actual users

        * Non technical friends, family

        * Give to small unit of target users

      * Test and adapt your app to realistic network conditions

        * Most users are probably on 3G or lower

        * Use Cache API and IndexedDB for file and content caching

        * Notify users on network state changes and give them options

          * E.g. *Google search caches search queries, replays them when 
          connections is next available then notifies user*

      * Use analytics tools to track app usage

        * Which features are never used 
        (* hamburger menu for tz websites *)

        * Experiment with unfamiliar interactions or content structure
